You retreat to the\nsanctity of home, each step\nweighed down by\ndefeat and doubt...
You drag yourself to\nthe Pokémon Center,\nto mend wounds and recall\nthe arrogance that led you here...
You vanish into the night,\nto recover and reflect...\non the quiet voice that warned you,\nbut came too late...
